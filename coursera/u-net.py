        For the function unet_model, specify the input shape, number of filters, and number of classes (23 in this case).

For the first half of the model:

Begin with a conv block that takes the inputs of the model and the number of filters
Then, chain the first output element of each block to the input of the next convolutional block
Next, double the number of filters at each step
Beginning with conv_block4, add dropout_prob of 0.3
For the final conv_block, set dropout_prob to 0.3 again, and turn off max pooling
For the second half:

Use cblock5 as expansive_input and cblock4 as contractive_input, with n_filters * 8. This is your bottleneck layer.
Chain the output of the previous block as expansive_input and the corresponding contractive block output.
Note that you must use the second element of the contractive block before the max pooling layer.
At each step, use half the number of filters of the previous block
conv9 is a Conv2D layer with ReLU activation, He normal initializer, same padding
Finally, conv10 is a Conv2D that takes the number of classes as the filter, a kernel size of 1, and "same" padding. 
The output of conv10 is the output of your model.
